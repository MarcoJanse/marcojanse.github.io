I'm very happy to have earned these certifications and I will share how I've prepared for these exams and my experience with them.

> Disclaimer: Everyone learns and prepares on his or hers own preferred way. I'm only sharing the methods I use and that seem to work for me. 

## Background

I've been doing Microsoft certifications since Windows 2000 (yes, I'm that old) and a lot has changed since then. During those days, study books were my main method of preparing for the exams and building a lab environment on spare hardware. 

These days, content changes so quickly, that physical books are often already outdated when they go to press, so I prefer learning with online materials. 

Also, cloud platforms, virtualization and containerization have made it much easier to create lab environments or to try things out quickly in a sandbox environment.

## How I prepare

First of all, it's good to combine experience with theory. I learn the best by reading the documentation and trying things out for myself.

### Microsoft Learn

I do most of my studying using Microsoft Learn. The Microsoft Learn portal gets better every day and it's free. You can register using a Microsoft account or GitHub account and then add all the learning modules for your certifcation track to a collection, learn on your own pace and continue where you left off the last time.

Some modules have excersises you can do either in a sandbox environment or in your own Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure account yet, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/) and get a credit of $200 that you can use for 30 days.

I like to take notes when I learn the modules with all the things I want to remember or review again before taking the exam.
I write these notes in a Markdown file and store them in a public GitHub repository for future reference. You can find these notes here:

- [AZ-305 - MS-Learn notes \| GitHub - Marco Janse](https://github.com/MarcoJanse/AZ-305/blob/main/MS-Learn/MS-Learn-notes-AZ-305.md)

### Other resources

Apart from MS-Learn, I someimes read some blogs about a specific subject that I want to know more about. 

#### Videos

In the past I have also used learning videos from A Cloud Guru or Pluralsight, but I guess I'm more of a reader type than a video type when it comes to learning. Sometimes I watch a video on YouTube with a demo of a subject that's hard to test by yourself in a lab environment (like creating an Express Route for instance). But most of the times, it's just me and MS-Learn.

## Practice Exams

After I have done most of the MS-Learn modules for a specific exam. I start doing a practice exam. Since
